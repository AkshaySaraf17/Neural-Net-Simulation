# Neural Network with Simulation

This project explores the implementation of a Neural Network using Python, coupled with a simulation to analyze its behavior and performance. Below is an outline of the key components and structure of the project.

## Project Overview
The project demonstrates how to:
- Implement a neural network from scratch.
- Train and evaluate the model using synthetic or simulated data.
- Analyze the performance of the network through metrics and visualizations.

## Features
- Data Simulation: The project includes scripts to generate synthetic datasets for training and evaluation.
- Custom Neural Network Implementation: A neural network is implemented step-by-step, covering forward propagation, loss calculation, and backpropagation.
- Training Process: Code for training the network using a gradient descent optimizer.
- Visualization: Performance metrics and loss curves are visualized for better understanding.

## File Structure
- **Notebook File**: Contains code and explanations for each step of the project.
  - Data generation and preprocessing.
  - Neural network architecture and implementation.
  - Training loop and evaluation.
  - Visualization of results.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scipy` (if applicable)

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `NeuralNet_with_simulation.ipynb`.
2. Execute cells sequentially to:
   - Generate synthetic data.
   - Build the neural network model.
   - Train and evaluate the model.
   - Visualize the results.

## Key Highlights
- **Simulation**: Focus on generating datasets with specific distributions to challenge the model.
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Built from scratch, illustrating the core concepts of machine learning.
- **Custom Loss Functions**: Implementation of Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Cross-Entropy Loss (depending on the dataset).
- **Performance Insights**: Visualization of loss trends during training.

## Results
The notebook provides insights into the behavior of the neural network during training, including:
- Loss reduction across epochs.
- Ability to predict synthetic data patterns.

## Customization
Users can:
- Modify the data generation process to test the model on different distributions.
- Adjust network hyperparameters like learning rate, number of layers, and neurons per layer.
- Extend the project to include additional metrics or datasets.
